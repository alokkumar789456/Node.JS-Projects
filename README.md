# Mini Projects

# Internship Practice Projects Repository

**Note:** Some projects may not run properly due to API expirations or .env configurations. Solving others' code can be hectic; it's better to use this repo as a reference. This is just my practice repo during my internship period (1 and 1/2 months).

I've created this repo to showcase my work and help new learners. The code may be messy, as it's just my practice work.

This repository contains various mini projects developed using Node.js. Each project showcases different concepts and functionalities.
